# QuicksApp – Instant WhatsApp Messaging Without Saving Contacts

## 🚀 Overview

**QuicksApp** is a lightweight Android application that allows users to send WhatsApp messages instantly **without saving the recipient’s phone number**. This app is perfect for users who frequently need to message new or temporary contacts, such as business inquiries, deliveries, customer support, or casual conversations.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Instant Messaging Without Saving Contacts** – Simply enter a number, type a message, and open a WhatsApp chat.
- **Country Code Picker** – Ensures the correct international phone format.
- **Internet Connectivity Check** – Alerts users if no internet connection is available.
- **WhatsApp Installation Check** – If WhatsApp is not installed, users are redirected to download it.
- **Auto-Clearing Inputs** – Ensures a smooth experience by clearing input fields after sending a message.
- **Minimal & Intuitive UI** – A clean, modern interface with a seamless user experience.

## 📌 How It Works

1. The user enters a phone number and message.
2. The app validates the input and checks for internet connectivity.
3. It verifies whether WhatsApp is installed on the device.
4. If installed, the app **opens WhatsApp with the message pre-filled**.
5. If not installed, the app redirects to the Play Store to install WhatsApp.

## 📌 Use Cases

- **Business & Customer Service:** Contact clients instantly without adding them as contacts.
- **Freelancers & Delivery Services:** Quickly message new clients/orders.
- **Casual Users:** Avoid cluttering contacts with temporary numbers.
