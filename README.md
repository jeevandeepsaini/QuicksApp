## 🚀 Overview

**QuicksApp** is a lightweight Android application that allows users to send WhatsApp messages instantly **without saving the recipient’s phone number**. This app is perfect for users who frequently need to message new or temporary contacts, such as business inquiries, deliveries, customer support, or casual conversations.
